@article{Abdalla:2010p3021,
	Abstract = {We use two independent methods to forecast the dark energy measurements
	achievable by combining future galaxy redshift surveys based on the
	radio HI emission line with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data
	from the Planck satellite. In the first method, we focus on the `standard
	ruler' provided by the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) length-scale.
	In the second method, we utilize additional information encoded in
	the galaxy power spectrum including galaxy bias from velocity-space
	distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. We find that a radio
	synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting area of
	the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), equipped with a wide (10-100 deg2)
	field of view, would have the capacity to perform a 20000 deg2 redshift
	survey to a maximum redshift zmax ~ 0.8 and thereby produce dark
	energy measurements that are competitive with surveys likely to be
	undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. There would then be
	powerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `Phase 1'
	SKA because of the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope
	sensitivity for HI surveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical
	redshift surveys. The full SKA telescope should, by performing a
	20000 deg2 HI redshift survey to zmax ~ 2 around 2020, yield an accurate
	measurement of cosmological parameters independent of CMB data sets.
	Combining CMB (Planck) and galaxy power spectrum (SKA) measurements
	will drive errors in the dark energy equation-of-state parameter
	w well below the 1 per cent level. The major systematic uncertainty
	in these forecasts is the lack of direct information about the mass
	function of high-redshift HI-emitting galaxies. `Stacking experiments'
	with SKA pathfinders will play an important role in resolving this
	uncertainty.},
